## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing **user, group, and role management** within ServiceNow by implementing **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and **automated workflows**.  
It streamlines the process of assigning roles, securing data access, and automating approvals — ensuring that every user has the right access at the right time.  
The solution improves **security, compliance, and operational efficiency** while reducing manual effort.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **User, Group, and Role Import:** Imports data from external sources using Import Sets and Transform Maps.  
- **Access Control Rules (ACLs):** Enforces secure, role-based data access.  
- **Role-Based Access Management:** Controls permissions for Admins, Managers, and End Users.  
- **Workflow Automation:** Automates role approvals and task assignments using Flow Designer.  
- **Dynamic Dashboards:** Provides real-time insights into access patterns and user activity.  
- **User Impersonation:** Tests role permissions and workflows in real-time.  
- **Scalability & Optimization:** Ensures smooth, secure, and efficient performance across enterprise environments.

## 📋 Requirement Analysis Phase
- Create two users (**Alice** and **Bob**).  
- Create two groups and assign users to them.  
- Define roles and assign them to users.  
- Create tables (**Project Table**, **Task Table**) for storing data.  
- Configure **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to protect data fields.  
- Build **Flows** for automated ticket and approval assignments.  
- Test all functionalities using **user impersonation**.

## 🗓️ Project Planning Phase
- Phases: **Ideation → Requirement Analysis → Design → Development → Testing → Reporting → Review.**  
- Tools Used: **ServiceNow Studio**, **Flow Designer**, **ACL Editor**, **Import Sets**, **Performance Analytics**.  
- Regular testing ensures accurate access and workflow functionality before deployment.

## ⚠️ Risk Management
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Incorrect role assignments | High | Medium | Use approval workflows and access reviews. |
| Misconfigured ACLs | High | Medium | Enforce least privilege and test via impersonation. |
| Role revocation delays | High | Medium | Automate de-provisioning through flows. |
| Workflow routing issues | High | Low | Test approval paths and set alerts for errors. |
